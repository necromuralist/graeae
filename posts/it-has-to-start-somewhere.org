This is the start of project /graeae/ - named after the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeae][three sisters]] of Greek mythology who were sisters to the gorgons and shared one eye and one tooth between them. This is a place where I'll stick the code that I end up using in more than one project that is convenient, but not really substantial enough to make into separate projects.
