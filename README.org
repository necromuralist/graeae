#+TITLE: Project Graeae

This is a repository to hold some common code that I share between projecs. It's named after the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeae][Graeae]], three sisters who share an eye and a tooth between them.

Any accompanying documentation will be [[https://necromuralist.github.io/graeae/][on github]].
